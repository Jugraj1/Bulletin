## Application Description

Bulletin is a dynamic social media platform tailored for students, scholars, and anyone passionate about the educational side of current affairs. Combining the features of a news feeder and a discussion forum, Bulletin is designed to foster intellectual engagement and facilitate the sharing of knowledge.

Academic Posts: 
Users can create posts that reference articles, academic papers, or any educational content. Each post allows users to share their insights, fostering a rich environment of knowledge exchange.



Academic Discussion Platform
Engage in thoughtful discussions in the comment sections of posts. Bulletin promotes a collaborative learning environment where ideas and opinions can be freely exchanged.





Academic Events and Articles publicising: 
Highlight significant events in academia by referencing and discussing them on the platform, making Bulletin a hub for the latest in educational developments. The appâ€™s algorithm curates a smart feed for the user, ensuring that the most relevant and intriguing content is always at the forefront.





Academic Networking: 
Build your academic network by following other users. Connect with peers and mentors and stay updated on their latest contributions and insights.




### Application Use Cases and or Examples
* Educational Resource: Students and educators can use the platform to find and share academic articles for coursework, assignments, and personal study, enhancing the learning experience.

* Academic Networking: There is a real argument to be made here. Scholars and researchers can connect with others in their field, share their latest publications, and collaborate on projects or research initiatives. This is an app with an intent to be educational and catering towards scholars, so it stays clear of recreational social media use.

* Research Promotion: Potentially, authors can promote their latest research papers, increasing visibility and potentially boosting citations and academic impact.

* Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: Because of the feed design, researchers from different fields can be encouraged to view articles outside their usual scope. Fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and innovations.

## Code Design and Decisions

This is an important section of your report and should include all technical decisions made. Well-written justifications will increase your marks for both the report as well as for the relevant parts (e.g., data structure). This includes, for example,

- Details about the parser (describe the formal grammar and language used)

- Decisions made (e.g., explain why you chose one or another data structure, why you used a specific data model, etc.)

- Details about the design patterns used (where in the code, justification of the choice, etc)

*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design.

### Data Structures

[What data structures did your team utilise? Where and why?]

Here is a partial (short) example for the subsection Data Structures:*

I used the following data structures in my project:

1. AVLTree
    * Objective: To store similarities among titles and unique post IDs.
    * *Code Locations: AVLTree class, the codes are adapted from the labs. There are helper functions related to AVLTree in the SearchUtils class: getIndexSizeFromTreeRec() method, insertFieldIndex() method.
    * Reasons:
        * Maintain a balanced structure, ensuring efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with a time complexity of O(log n)
        * AVL trees support range-based operations efficiently, facilitating tasks such as finding elements within a specific range or performing range queries, which can be further extended to more features in the future such as filter by dates

2. HashMaps
    * Objective: store the full content of the posts returned from the database.
    * *Code Locations: SearchResultsActivity class.
    * Reasons:
        * HashMaps offer fast access to elements based on their keys, providing a constant-time complexity of O(1) for average-case operations like insertion, retrieval, and deletion.
        * HashMaps allow storing key-value pairs, enabling efficient data retrieval based on unique keys
        * HashMaps dynamically resize to maintain an optimal load factor, ensuring efficient space utilisation while accommodating varying numbers of elements

3. ArrayList
    * Objective: To store the most relevant posts for displaying.
    * *Code Locations: SearchResultsActivity class.
    * Reasons:
        * ArrayLists automatically resize themselves as elements are added or removed. This is important since the number of posts is dynamic.
        * HashMaps allow storing key-value pairs, enabling efficient data retrieval based on unique keys
        * HashMaps dynamically resize to maintain an optimal load factor, ensuring efficient space utilisation while accommodating varying numbers of elements

Summary
Data structures play a crucial role in efficiently searching for posts. When a user inputs a 'title' and specific dates of interest, the resulting page aims to display posts with the most
relevance. Our search process begins by querying the database for posts falling within the
date range specified by the user, effectively narrowing down the pool of resources.
Subsequently, we employ a HashMap<String, Post> to store the retrieved posts from the
database. Each post is uniquely identified by its ID, serving as the key, while the full content
of the post constitutes the corresponding value.
To prioritise the most relevant posts, we compute the similarity of the input title with each
post title retrieved from the database. This computation yields a series of similarity values,
indicating the relevance of each post. Simultaneously, an AVL tree is utilised to organise
these similarities and their corresponding posts. Each node within the AVL tree comprises a
key-value pair, with the key representing the similarity and the value containing a set of
unique post IDs. For instance, a node with {key: 0.6, value: {1, 2}} signifies that both post ID
1 and post ID 2 exhibit a similarity of 0.6 concerning the user-provided title.
Upon the user's search, the results page initially showcases the top three most relevant
posts by retrieving the top 3 post IDs from the AVL tree. Subsequently, the full content of
these posts is accessed from the HashMap using their respective IDs. After retrieving these
three posts, they will be stored in an ArrayList for display purposes, and their information will
be promptly removed from the AVL tree to optimise resource utilisation Moreover, if
additional relevant titles exist, users can click the "more" button to unveil the subsequent
three posts. In this scenario, our tree is updated by removing the displayed posts, ensuring
the continuous refinement of search results.

### Design Patterns
*[What design patterns did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

. *xxx Pattern*
   * *Objective: used for storing xxxx for xxx feature.*
   * *Code Locations: defined in [Class X, methods Z, Y](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2100/group-project/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/items/media/_examples/Dummy.java#L22-43) and [class AnotherClass, lines l1-l2](url); processed using [dataStructureHandlerMethod](url) and ...
   * *Reasons:*
      * ...

1. *Singleton*
   * In our android project, we implemented a Firebase connection to handle database operations, such as writing to the database, reading data from the database, and editing data in the database. To ensure efficient use of resources to access the firebase, we implemented a singleton design pattern by creating a Firebase Connection class. This design choice was made to ensure that a single connection to the firebase database will be used in the app, and all the different activities will call on the same connection whenever they need to access the database. 

   * We note that Firebase already has some form of Singleton pattern (managed behind the scenes), however we believe this is a good design choice, as we will be able to maintain a singular connection to the database if our app moved away from Firebase, and to another database service that didnâ€™t handle its own Singleton pattern internally.

   * This choice made the code easier to read and understand, and improved the performance of the app as the user does not have to wait for a new connection every time they go to a new page. It also improved scalability and maintainability as every new page simply has to call the same connection, instead of rewriting the same code again. 

2. *Factory*
   * Our android project also implemented the Factory design pattern to handle notifications. The factory design pattern allows us to create different types of notifications. This can help us differentiate between notifications from your post being liked to your post being created. The factory design pattern means that we can scale up and add different types of notifications for future development, such as a notification when a user you follow creates a new post etc.

   * The factory design pattern was implemented with a notification class, and a notification data interface. To create the different notification types, they extend the notification class and call on a related instance of the notification data interface (that holds all the information about the specific notification, such as the number of likes) to fill the notification with the appropriate data. All the different notifications are then handled in the NotificationFactory to call on the appropriate notification type.

3. Observer
   * In order to periodically refresh the UI with new information from the database, the Observer design pattern was suitable, since it ensured that the UI is only updated when there is a change in the monitored state in the database.

   * When a change is detected by the Subject (UpdateFeed / UpdatePostView / UpdateProfile), the relevant Observer (HomeFeed / PostView / ProfileView) is notified, and given the new state to update the UI with. 

   * The Observer and Subject interfaces use a Generic parameter so that the Observer can update itself with whatever information is sent to it. The HomeFeed is notified with a new list of posts to display; The PostView is notified with a new Post to display; The Profile view is notified with a new User to display. Since different types are being used, the Generic parameter was used.

   * By using the Observer design pattern, we have essentially created a database trigger, allowing us to efficiently refresh the app, as required for the Datastreams feature.

### Parser

### <u>Grammar(s)</u>

Production Rules
```
<search>  ::= <title> <author> | <title>
<title>   ::= <word> space <title> | <word>
<author>  ::= @ LBRA <name> RBRA
<name>    ::= <word> space <name> | <word>
<word>    ::= char <word> | char 

``` 
Here, 'char' is an element in the set {a, ..., z, A, ..., Z} and the set of special characters (see further details in the CharExp class under the com.example.app_2100.search.parser package). Note that '@' is excluded because it is used as an identifier for the author.

Our grammar defines the validity of the content provided in the search bar by the user. It accepts either a title followed by an authorID, where the authorID is identified through '@()', or just the title alone. If the input does not satisfy this grammar, a message will pop up to inform the user.





### <u>Tokenizers and Parsers</u>


* The Tokenizer class will be responsible for dividing the input sentence into tokens. The token types are as follows: CHAR, SPACE, AT, LBRA, RBRA. Here, CHAR represents any character, while SPACE accounts for spaces between words. AT, LBRA, and RBRA correspond to '@()', which are responsible for identifying the author ID.

* Our parser provides the flexibility of searches that allow searching both authors and titles. Given an input search content in the format of a title followed by an authorID, the parser will output the title and authorID. Then, information related to that authorID will be displayed on the result page, as well as posts that are relevant to the titles. If the user does not exist, relevant posts will still be displayed, but the author will no longer be shown.

* We followed the recursive definition of tokenizers and parsers from the lab exercises instead of using regular expressions. This is because such recursive definitions provide a clear correspondence to the definition of the grammar and can be easily extended if we want to include more features.

## Implemented Features
*[What features have you implemented? where, how, and why?]* <br>
*List all features you have completed in their separate categories with their featureId. THe features must be one of the basic/custom features, or an approved feature from Voice Four Feature.*

### Basic Features
1. Login:

   * Users are able to login through the login page. Our app uses an instance of the Firebase connection. When the users click on the login button, the app connects to firebase and uses the existing firebase sign in method. Heavily relying on callbacks, if authentication is a success, then the user is redirected to the home page, otherwise it will fail, and tell the user â€˜Authentication failedâ€™
2. Datafiles:


2. LoadShowData:

   * Loading and displaying data is central to interacting with our app, involving activities like creating accounts, uploading profile pictures, creating posts, following users, commenting on posts, and liking posts. Most app activities revolve around displaying user-generated data.

   * HomeFeed: Displays posts from various users.
ProfileViewer: Shows user details, followers, and their posts.
PostView: Loads post content, author details, and comments.
Given the extensive Firebase interactions required during these activities, we decided to enhance readability by creating separate helper methods for data and UI interactions within the onCreate method. This approach reduces complexity and improves maintainability.



```

protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
   super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
   setContentView(R.layout.activity_profile_viewer); // Set activity layout
   db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance(); // Initialize FireStore
   userID = getIntent().getStringExtra("authorID"); // Get authorID from Intent
   loggedInUserID = FirebaseAuthConnection.getAuth().getUid(); // Get logged-in user's ID


   fetchUser(userID); // Fetch user details from FireStore


   // Set onClickListener for Home Button to navigate to HomeFeed activity
   findViewById(R.id.homeButton).setOnClickListener(view -> {
       startActivity(new Intent(ProfileViewer.this, HomeFeed.class));
   });
       // Set onClickListener for Follow button
       followButton.setOnClickListener(view -> followAuthor(userID));
   }
}
```
In this code snippet for profileviewer, even though this is a data-heavy activity, the onCreate doesn't deal with the data retrieval from firestore and the I updates directly. All are done through helper methods. It just sets the instances for Firestore and sets the listeners.


3. DataStream:
   * HomeFeed, PostView, and ProfileViewer are updated every 500ms if there is a change in the database state. This is achieved using the Observer design pattern, in which the Subjects (UpdateFeed, UpdatePostView, UpdateProfile) are constantly querying the database. If there is a change to the current state, e.g.  post ranking changes, user information changes, etc, the relevant Activity will be notified, and it will update its UI to match the new database state.

   * This is efficient because the UI is only updated when there is a change in the database state, meaning that there aren't unnecessary refreshes to the page theyâ€™re viewing. If there is no change after 500ms (the time period), then nothing will be updated.




4. Search:
   * Users have the option to input a title they wish to search for. Additionally, two buttons are available, enabling users to specify the type of data and the desired date range for searching posts. Moreover, users can append a username at the end of their search query, enhancing the results page to also display the profile of the specified user, if it exists.
   * On the results page, the top three most relevant posts matching the user-provided title will be displayed initially. By clicking the "More" button, users can access the next three relevant posts.


   <br>

### Custom Features
Search-Invalid:
If a user enters text in the search bar that doesn't adhere to our grammar, such as 'sport article @@(adith)' (where double '@' symbols are not allowed), the results page will indicate that the input is invalid. Similarly, if the date provided by the user for 'date-from' is later than the one provided for 'date-to', we will also expect the input to be invalid.










Search-Filter:
Our search results can be filtered by the date range specified by the user, using 'date-from' and 'date-to' parameters. This ensures that only posts within the specified dates are displayed. Additionally, our parser extracts the username from the text if provided, and the profile of that user is displayed on the results page.
UI-Layout
The UI layout for the login page was straightforward with mainly using editTexts for inputs, textViews, and buttons. To ensure that the app is responsive in both portrait and landscape modes, 2 layouts were used to have different layouts in landscape and portrait. In landscape mode, a Linear layout was added to divide the screen into two parts. The welcome text and the login user inputs. With a constraint layout within it. Another linear layout was used for the input section, and a constraint layout within it to place all the input text fields, and buttons appropriately.
The screenshots below show the component tree of the login page, and the corresponding view in a landscape view.


For the create account page, a similar method was used to ensure responsiveness in both portrait and landscape mode. However, This time a scroll view was added to help the user scroll through all the text inputs, as there were a significant amount of them. And a shape view is used to display the profile picture throughout the application. 
The home feed was a bit more challenging and was divided into three parts. The top profile and search bar, the bottom navigation bar, and the main posts view. The top bar included a â€˜Trendingâ€™ Textview, a search button, and a profile picture imageview with a listener that sends the user to their profile page when clicked on it. The bottom navigation bar uses two buttons to navigate. One for home feed, and the other to create a new post. The main posts view used a recycler view to display all the posts. The recycler view helped us create an infinite scroll for the user, so that their immersion is not broken and they have an infinite data stream of content.


The profile viewer used textviews and imageviews to display user information. A tab layout to divide the posts created by the user, and all of the people that the user is following, and only one is shown at a time.


Data-Profile:

Our android application has a page to view the profile of every user created. The profile page shows all the relevant information about the user (first name, last name, username) in a text view. It has an imageview to show the users profile picture. The page uses tab layout to also show the users posts and the people they follow. The profile page access the firestore storage to access the images of all the users. The images are stored as â€˜[userid].jpgâ€™ in the storage, under the â€˜pfpâ€™ folder. Once they are downloaded, the bitmap is used to display the image. Furthermore, if the profile page is showing the current users, profile, it will also display a button to sign them out, and if the profile page is showing other users, it will instead display a button to follow them.

FB-Auth:
The firebase authentication is used to sign the users in, and it uses callbacks to carry out actions if it fails or succeeds to sign the users in.
private void signIn(String email, String password) {
   FirebaseAuthConnection.getInstance().signIn(email, password, new AuthCallback() {
       @Override
       public void onAuthentication(boolean success) {
           if (success) {
               // Authentication succeeded
               Log.d(TAG, "signInWithEmail:success");
               Toast.makeText(Login.this, "Authentication succeeded.", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();


               // We are logged in, so we can access currently logged in user using Firebase
               FirebaseUser currUser = FirebaseAuthConnection.getInstance().getAuth().getCurrentUser();
               if (currUser != null) {
                   startActivity(new Intent(Login.this, HomeFeed.class)); // Go to home page since login is validated
                   finish();
               } else {
                   Log.w(TAG, "signInWithEmail: logged-in account is null");
               }
           } else {
               // Authentication failed
               Log.w(TAG, "signInWithEmail:failure");
               Toast.makeText(Login.this, "Authentication failed.", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
           }
       }
   });
}


FB-Persist:


Interact-Micro:
Bulletin enables users to comment on and like posts created by themselves or others, implementing the Interact-Micro functionality. This feature is integrated into both the HomeFeed and PostViewer, allowing users to engage with content directly and easily. By enabling these interactions, Bulletin fosters a dynamic and engaging user experience where users can actively participate and express their preferences. The interactions are clearly displayed within the PostView class allowing Posts to act like items to be interacted with.


Interact-Follow:
Additionally, Bulletin allows users to follow other users, which is implemented in the ProfileViewer activity. Users can view their following list within the ProfileViewer itself, displayed as a linear layout within a ScrollView.The following list is a section dedicated to only the items (Users) being followed and is stored in memory as a separate field within the user document.  This setup meets the requirements for the Follow functionality, providing users with a straightforward way to keep track of and access the profiles they are interested in.
