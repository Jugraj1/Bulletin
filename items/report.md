# [G63 - RAJ NP] Report

The following is a report template to help your team successfully provide all the details necessary for your report in a structured and organised manner. Please give a straightforward and concise report that best demonstrates your project. Note that a good report will give a better impression of your project to the reviewers.

Note that you should have removed ALL TEMPLATE/INSTRUCTION textes in your submission (like the current sentence), otherwise it hampers the professionality in your documentation.

*Here are some tips to write a good report:*

* `Bullet points` are allowed and strongly encouraged for this report. Try to summarise and list the highlights of your project (rather than give long paragraphs).*

* *Try to create `diagrams` for parts that could greatly benefit from it.*

* *Try to make your report `well structured`, which is easier for the reviewers to capture the necessary information.*

*We give instructions enclosed in square brackets [...] and examples for each sections to demonstrate what are expected for your project report. Note that they only provide part of the skeleton and your description should be more content-rich. Quick references about markdown by [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/)*

## Summary of Individual Contributions

Specific details of individual contribution of each member to the project.

Each team member is responsible for writing **their own subsection**.

A generic summary will not be acceptable and may result in a significant lose of marks.

*[Summarise the contributions made by each member to the project, e.g. code implementation, code design, UI design, report writing, etc.]*

*[Code Implementation. Which features did you implement? Which classes or methods was each member involved in? Provide an approximate proportion in pecentage of the contribution of each member to the whole code implementation, e.g. 30%.]*

*you should ALSO provide links to the specified classes and/or functions*
Note that the core criteria of contribution is based on `code contribution` (the technical developing of the App).

*Here is an example: (Note that you should remove the entire section (e.g. "others") if it is not applicable)*

1. **UID1, Name1**  I have 30% contribution, as follows: <br>
  - **Code Contribution in the final App**
    - Feature A1, A2, A3 - class Dummy: [Dummy.java](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2100/group-project/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/items/media/_examples/Dummy.java)
    - XYZ Design Pattern -  class AnotherClass: [functionOne()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2100/group-project/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/items/media/_examples/Dummy.java#L22-43), [function2()](the-URL)
    - ... (any other contribution in the code, including UI and data files) ... [Student class](../src/path/to/class/Student.java), ..., etc.*, [LanguageTranslator class](../src/path/to/class/LanguageTranslator.java): function1(), function2(), ... <br><br>

  - **Code and App Design** 
    - [What design patterns, data structures, did the involved member propose?]*
    - [UI Design. Specify what design did the involved member propose? What tools were used for the design?]* <br><br>

  - **Others**: (only if significant and significantly different from an "average contribution") 
    - [Report Writing?] [Slides preparation?]*
    - [You are welcome to provide anything that you consider as a contribution to the project or team.] e.g., APK, setups, firebase* <br><br>

2. **UID2, Name2**  I have xx% contribution, as follows: <br>
  - ...

## Code Design and Decisions

This is an important section of your report and should include all technical decisions made. Well-written justifications will increase your marks for both the report as well as for the relevant parts (e.g., data structure). This includes, for example,

- Details about the parser (describe the formal grammar and language used)

- Decisions made (e.g., explain why you chose one or another data structure, why you used a specific data model, etc.)

- Details about the design patterns used (where in the code, justification of the choice, etc)

*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design.

### Data Structures

*[What data structures did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

Here is a partial (short) example for the subsection `Data Structures`:*

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

1. *LinkedList*
   * *Objective: used for storing xxxx for xxx feature.*
   * *Code Locations: defined in [Class X, methods Z, Y](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2100/group-project/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/items/media/_examples/Dummy.java#L22-43) and [class AnotherClass, lines l1-l2](url); processed using [dataStructureHandlerMethod](url) and ...
   * *Reasons:*
      * *It is more efficient than Arraylist for insertion with a time complexity O(1)*
      * *We don't need to access the item by index for xxx feature because...*
      * For the (part), the data ... (characteristics) ...

### Design Patterns
*[What design patterns did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

. *xxx Pattern*
   * *Objective: used for storing xxxx for xxx feature.*
   * *Code Locations: defined in [Class X, methods Z, Y](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2100/group-project/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/items/media/_examples/Dummy.java#L22-43) and [class AnotherClass, lines l1-l2](url); processed using [dataStructureHandlerMethod](url) and ...
   * *Reasons:*
      * ...

1. *Singleton*
   * In our android project, we implemented a Firebase connection to handle database operations, such as writing to the database, reading data from the database, and editing data in the database. To ensure efficient use of resources to access the firebase, we implemented a singleton design pattern by creating a Firebase Connection class. This design choice was made to ensure that a single connection to the firebase database will be used in the app, and all the different activities will call on the same connection whenever they need to access the database. 

   * We note that Firebase already has some form of Singleton pattern (managed behind the scenes), however we believe this is a good design choice, as we will be able to maintain a singular connection to the database if our app moved away from Firebase, and to another database service that didn’t handle its own Singleton pattern internally.

   * This choice made the code easier to read and understand, and improved the performance of the app as the user does not have to wait for a new connection every time they go to a new page. It also improved scalability and maintainability as every new page simply has to call the same connection, instead of rewriting the same code again. 

2. *Factory*
   * Our android project also implemented the Factory design pattern to handle notifications. The factory design pattern allows us to create different types of notifications. This can help us differentiate between notifications from your post being liked to your post being created. The factory design pattern means that we can scale up and add different types of notifications for future development, such as a notification when a user you follow creates a new post etc.

   * The factory design pattern was implemented with a notification class, and a notification data interface. To create the different notification types, they extend the notification class and call on a related instance of the notification data interface (that holds all the information about the specific notification, such as the number of likes) to fill the notification with the appropriate data. All the different notifications are then handled in the NotificationFactory to call on the appropriate notification type.

3. Observer
   * In order to periodically refresh the UI with new information from the database, the Observer design pattern was suitable, since it ensured that the UI is only updated when there is a change in the monitored state in the database.

   * When a change is detected by the Subject (UpdateFeed / UpdatePostView / UpdateProfile), the relevant Observer (HomeFeed / PostView / ProfileView) is notified, and given the new state to update the UI with. 

   * The Observer and Subject interfaces use a Generic parameter so that the Observer can update itself with whatever information is sent to it. The HomeFeed is notified with a new list of posts to display; The PostView is notified with a new Post to display; The Profile view is notified with a new User to display. Since different types are being used, the Generic parameter was used.

   * By using the Observer design pattern, we have essentially created a database trigger, allowing us to efficiently refresh the app, as required for the Datastreams feature.

### Parser

### <u>Grammar(s)</u>

Production Rules
```
<search>  ::= <title> <author> | <title>
<title>   ::= <word> space <title> | <word>
<author>  ::= @ LBRA <name> RBRA
<name>    ::= <word> space <name> | <word>
<word>    ::= char <word> | char 

``` 
Here, 'char' is an element in the set {a, ..., z, A, ..., Z} and the set of special characters (see further details in the CharExp class under the com.example.app_2100.search.parser package). Note that '@' is excluded because it is used as an identifier for the author.

Our grammar defines the validity of the content provided in the search bar by the user. It accepts either a title followed by an authorID, where the authorID is identified through '@()', or just the title alone. If the input does not satisfy this grammar, a message will pop up to inform the user.





### <u>Tokenizers and Parsers</u>


* The Tokenizer class will be responsible for dividing the input sentence into tokens. The token types are as follows: CHAR, SPACE, AT, LBRA, RBRA. Here, CHAR represents any character, while SPACE accounts for spaces between words. AT, LBRA, and RBRA correspond to '@()', which are responsible for identifying the author ID.

* Our parser provides the flexibility of searches that allow searching both authors and titles. Given an input search content in the format of a title followed by an authorID, the parser will output the title and authorID. Then, information related to that authorID will be displayed on the result page, as well as posts that are relevant to the titles. If the user does not exist, relevant posts will still be displayed, but the author will no longer be shown.

* We followed the recursive definition of tokenizers and parsers from the lab exercises instead of using regular expressions. This is because such recursive definitions provide a clear correspondence to the definition of the grammar and can be easily extended if we want to include more features.
