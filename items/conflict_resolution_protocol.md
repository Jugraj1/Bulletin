# Conflict Resolution Protocol

1. Introduction

The purpose of this part is to outline the conflict resolution protocol for our Java project in Android Studio, managed through GitLab. This protocol ensures that conflicts arising during the development process are addressed promptly and efficiently to maintain project progress and team cohesion.

2. Communication Channels

   Primary Communication Channel: We utilize two WhatsApp groups:
    * Project Commits: This group is dedicated to updating commit information and tracking project progress.
    * Project General: The main project group is used for general communication, discussions, and coordination among team members.

3. Reporting Conflicts

   When a team member encounters a conflict, they are responsible for promptly reporting it through the dedicated WhatsApp group (Project Genearl) and initiating the resolution process. The following steps will be followed to resolve conflicts:

    * Assessment and Discussion: The assigned team member will assess the reported conflict to understand its nature and severity. If necessary, a discussion will be initiated within the WhatsApp group to gather insights and perspectives from team members.

    * Implementation and Verification: Upon reaching a consensus, the resolution will be implemented by the assigned team member. After implementation, the team will verify that the conflict has been successfully resolved and ensure no adverse impacts on project integrity.
